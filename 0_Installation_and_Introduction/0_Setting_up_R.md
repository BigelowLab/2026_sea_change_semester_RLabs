# Why R?

Computational skills for research oceanography are important! R is just
one of many programming languages that you could use - it is one of the
most commonly used language in marine ecology / biology realm, but
Python (or MATLAB) are more commonly used in physical oceanography.

OK, but why are computational skills important?

1.  From a practical point of view, oceanographic data can be complex:
    you may be working with large volumes of data, data from different
    sources that you need to combine, different types of data (CTD vs
    discrete samples), or with models. It may not be possible to do what
    you want to do in Excel (or it could be really cumbersome and error
    prone).
2.  Helps with reproducible science i.e., enabling someone (maybe
    yourself!) to repeat your experiment and replicate your results -
    this includes data analysis! Reproducible science is important for
    scientific integrity, facilitates collaboration and helps support
    open science.

Learning to Code in the AI era

1.  Part of scientific discovery involves working directly with the
    data.
2.  By coding and analyzing data yourself, you can see gaps and caveats
    that would be missed if you just rely on AI.
3.  Learning the code helps you understand your data better and how
    different data types are related.
4.  Learning to code yourself can be frustrating, but also very
    satisfying!

And a couple of best practices as you dive deeper into this world:

1.  Documentation - document everything! Use a notebook (electronic or
    otherwise)
2.  Organization - think about this before you start and find something
    that works for you.
3.  Automation - think about developing methods in small, reusable
    chunks e.g., to process data or make figures
4.  Dissemination - for our research to be truely reproducible, our full
    methods need to be shared, including code!

Final thought on reproducibility and computational research skills:
**think about how to make things easier on a colleague and future you.
Future you is your closest collaborator, but past you does not respond
to emails. You’d be surprised how quickly you forget something.**

# R and RStudio

R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical
integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier
and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.
After installing both programs, you will need to install some specific R
packages within RStudio. Follow the instructions below to install both:

# Installation instructions

1.  Follow the instructions to download R from the [CRAN
    website](https://cran.r-project.org/) for your operating system
2.  Run the downloaded file to install R
3.  Go to the [RStudio download
    page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    and follow the instructions to download RStudio for your operating
    system

# Getting Started with RStudio

The following gives a great overview on the differences between R and
RStudio, familiarizing yourself with RStudio and starting a session in
RStudio:

## Setting up RStudio

1.  Create a folder where you are going to do all your lab work.
    Remember, organization is key! I recommend setting up a folder for
    all these lessons (e.g., ~/course1_RLab/).
2.  Start RStudio.
3.  We need to set the working directory. This is where R will look for
    all your data files, scripts (more on those later) and save any of
    your work. There are a few ways to do this:
    - Go to Session -\> Set Working Directory -\> Choose Directory and
      browse to the folder you just created
    - In the Files Pane navigate to your lab folder, then click More -\>
      Set as Working Directory
    - At the console prompt type `setwd('full/path/to/folder')`
4.  Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio. To do this, go
    to Tools –\> ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for
    ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’

### Installing packages

The above instructions for installing R installs the **base** version of
R. It has a bunch of default functions we can use. But there a lot of
additional **packages** for R which contain even more functions for us
to use. Let’s install two we’ll need for class.

`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
`install.packages("akima")`

# R Markdown

You can create documents that have text, figures and R code all in the
same document using R Markdown. These R Markdown files (or R Notebooks -
more later) are really useful for reproducible science because you can
put all the information into one document in a clear, presentable way.
We do all my research using these - we think of them as lab books, we
don’t keep a pen and paper lab book anymore. And all the lab scripts
we’ve written for this course were done in R Markdown.

## What is Markdown?

(adapted from
[markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/))

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add
formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber
in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup
languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG (what you see is what
you get) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click
buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible
immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a
Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate
which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to create **bold** text you would type
`**this text is bold**`.

To create your final document, you need to **render** your markdown
file.

## R Markdown and R Notebooks

In RStudio, you can create a R Notebook or a R Markdown file. In terms
of how you write or code in them, they are the same. The difference
comes in how they are rendered.

R Markdown files need to be **knitted**. When you knit a file, it runs
all the code chunks, and formats all your text. You can knit a R
Markdown file into a PDF or a html file or some other formats.

Whereas, a R Notebook file’s default output is HTML. This means you can
**Preview**, rather than knit, the file to render it. This is much
faster because it doesn’t run all the code, it just displays the output
from the last time the code was run.

To start either a R notebook or R markdown file, press the symbol on the
toolbar that has a green plus and white sheet of paper. Then select
either ‘R Notebook’ or ‘R Markdown’. In each case, the new file will
have default/example text and information that explains how to create
the file.

There’s lots of information online about R Markdown, check out the
[RStudio R Markdown
website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), [this reference
sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdfhttps://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
which shows examples of lots of different text formatting you might want
to do, and [this cheat
sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).
